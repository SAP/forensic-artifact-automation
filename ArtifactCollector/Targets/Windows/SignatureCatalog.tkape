# Documentation
# Validating digital signatures of an offline system can be problematic.
# Microsoft relies mostly on detached signature files to sign Windows
# executables.  Checking those on an offline system using sigcheck.exe
# from SysInternals requires importing the target system's detached
# signature files into the anlysis system.  To use with sigcheck, slightly
# rename the collected GUID directories (keeping the names in a GUID format),
# copy them to C:\Windows\System32\CatRoot of your analysis machine, restart
# Cryptographic Services, then run sigcheck against the target system files.
# This will import the target's signature files into the local analysis
# machine's signature database and should accurately validate the target
# system's files (which presumabley were collected with other KAPE modules).
# Kudos to Troy Larson for providing this workaround technique.
