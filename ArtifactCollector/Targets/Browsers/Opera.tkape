# Opera is a third-party web browser that has a small market share compared to the bigger names.
# The Local folder is mostly going to contain cache files that are not readable in a text editor.
# The Roaming folder is where one can find the most useful information.
# Within Roaming, IndexedDB folder will have folders named after URLs the user navigates to.
# Within Roaming, Session Storage will have logs with the naming convention of XXXXXX.log that increment as they are rolled over. Within these files are URLs the user navigated to in a given session.
